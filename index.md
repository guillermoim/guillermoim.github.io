I am a PhD candidate at the [AI&ML research group](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml){:target="_blank"} in Universitat Pompeu Fabra. I am working under the supervision of professors Anders Jonsson and Vicenç Gómez. Our research is focused on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning. I also did a research stay under the supervision of Herke van Hoof at University of Amsterdam.

Before, I graduated from Universitat Pompeu Fabra with a MSc in Intelligent Interactive Systems (2020) where I wrote my thesis on Deepfake detection with deep learning in collaboration with Carlos Segura and Ferrán Diego at [Telefónica Research](https://www.telefonica.com/en/sustainability-innovation/innovation/){:target="_blank"}.
