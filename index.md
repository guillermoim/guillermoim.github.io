Since November 2020 I am a PhD student at the [AI&ML research group](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml){:target="_blank"} in Universitat Pompeu Fabra. I am working under the supervision of professors Anders Jonsson and  and our research is focused on Reinforcement Learning. Previously, I graduated from Universidad de Sevilla with a BSc in Computer science (2019) and from Universitat Pompeu Fabra with a MSc in Intelligent Interactive Systems (2020). During my undergraduate studies, I spent one academic year at TU Eindhoven (2018-2019) under the Erasmus+ program.
