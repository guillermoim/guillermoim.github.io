[Gradfolio](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio){:target="_blank"} is a responsive, dark-mode ready Jekyll theme designed keeping academia in mind. The easiest way to install the theme is to fork it using GitHub. Check the README file for [instructions](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio#installation){:target="_blank"}.

Since November 2020 I am a PhD student at the [AI&ML research group](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml){:target="_blank"} in Universitat Pompeu Fabra. I am working under the supervision of professors Anders Jonsson and Vicenç Gómez and our research is focused on Reinforcement Learning.
